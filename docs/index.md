    This is one of the only apps that allows the proper display of CSV files.
    The UI stays smooth across even with files that contain thousands of rows, 
    and it can even search through them effortlessly. 
    The developer is very responsive and quickly pushed an update to address an issue I was having with a given file.

    There was an issue with the file, but the developer helped to find the problem. So the app works fine, and right now, after trying everything else, I think it’s the best instrument for viewing the csv in the play market

    Great app! Looks beautiful works well and it’s fast. It’s the only csv viewer which allowed me to view a 200 mb csv file. Keep up the good work. Just purchased the pro version
