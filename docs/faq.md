### Which chart types are supported?

Currently, Smart CSV Viewer support column chart, bar chart, line chart, area chart, spline chart, scatter chart, step line chart, and step area chart.

### What do you mean by “customizable”?

In Smart CSV Viewer you can custom as much as you can. For example, when you only want to copy a part of data in a row, you can use the “filter” feature to exclude it. You can extract data by column. When you export to a pdf file, you can custom the style (color scheme) to match your expectation. More than a CSV converter tool, now you can change the look of your pdf file by styling it.


### Why my file not being updated?

If your file has been updated, you will need to re-import it. During the import process, the CSV file will be imported into the SQLite database. Consequently, you will be able to instantly view the updated file and utilize SQL queries to retrieve your data.
